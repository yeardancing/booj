booj player - control something that has music and a way to play it
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Quickstart: execute the following line

    PYTHONPATH=. python booj/controller.py booj.db

What booj player is
-------------------
Somebody's first web application that attempts to let a user control music
on their computer from a phone, tablet or other mobile device.

Built using cherrypy (www.cherrypy.org) and jQuery Mobile (jquerymobile.com)

What booj player is not
-----------------------
A streaming music server.  All the music you want to play is expected to
live on the device that is playing it/hosting booj.  The original idea
was to run on a Raspberry Pi (www.raspberrypi.org) connected to an amplifier.

one and I am an embedded systems person.
